                <p>
                    I love learning and solving challenging problems. That is why I decided to spend my winter break learning how to build this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while having no previous experience working with these languages. I also started my Python journey by teaching myself to scrape web data to guide my unroasted coffee buying decisions. To prepare for becoming the Controller of my family businesses, I decided to challenge myself by starting the process to become a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Charterholder. Although I am still waiting to take the third CFA exam for the first time after COVID, I passed the first two exams in my first sitting and the second exam in the 90th percentile. In Fall 2020, I began a Master’s Degree in Data Science at DePaul University. I am excited about the opportunity to further develop my data science skills. I plan on finding a career where I could put them to use by uncovering patterns and finding data-driven solutions. Before enrolling at DePaul and being Controller, I was a data analyst at a PR firm in New York. I graduated from Indiana University in 2014 with a bachelor’s degree in Economics, an honors certificate through the Liberal Arts and Management Program, and a minor in political science.

I taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build this website from scratch. This is the first website I have coded and I tried to incorporate as many HTML semantic elements as I could. I do not intend to be a web designer but learned to code a website to learn more coding languages like JavaScript and better understand how websites work to help build web crawlers more efficiently using Python.

I did not include the image files in the respository. To see the images, please visit tylerboudart.com
